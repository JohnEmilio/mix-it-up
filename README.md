## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, API, MongoDB, CSS

Mix It Up Cocktails will be built using React on the frontend utilizing various React packages and hooks. Our users will interact with a built-in 3rd party API that will retrieve information about the cocktails and recipes. A RestAPI will command our Node.js and Express backend which will store and retrieve data from our MongoDB. Users can expect to be able to save their favorite recipes and view what other members have saved.
